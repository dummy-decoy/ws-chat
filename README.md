# ws-chat
An IRC like online chat running in your web browser using WebSockets

## Running the chat server

The chat server runs with node.js. After [installing node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager), execute the server by typing on a command line:

> `node server.js`

The server listens to **port 80** by default. However, you can change this port on the command line:

> `node server.js 5000`

You can now open a browser and browse to the url of the server, the server will display the client interface.
